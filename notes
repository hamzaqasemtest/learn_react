why react 

    talk about an example with search and fillters 

        the main aim for react to sync data with the UI

        acess and change dom state directly 

        complex js code (spagaitii)

react-steps 

    render
    click-event
    update-state
    rerender

what react 

    compnents (html)
    decleritve 
    abstraction of dom (never touch the dom)
    state-driven (reacts to change of data)
    library not framework (view-layer)

react hooks 

    useState
    useEffect

what does strictmode does 

    render component twice 

        to find certain bugs
        ensure not using outdated code 


components 

    starts with uppercase 
    returns markup or null 


never nest components {
    function ComponentA(){
        function ComponentB(){...}
    }
}
