why react 

    talk about an example with search and fillters 

        the main aim for react to sync data with the UI

        acess and change dom state directly 

        complex js code (spagaitii)

react-steps 

    render
    click-event
    update-state
    rerender

what react 

    compnents (html)
    decleritve 
    abstraction of dom (never touch the dom)
    state-driven (reacts to change of data)
    library not framework (view-layer)
    one way data flow

react hooks 

    useState
    useEffect

what does strictmode does 

    render component twice 

        to find certain bugs
        ensure not using outdated code 


components 

    starts with uppercase 
    returns markup or null 


never nest components {
    function ComponentA(){
        function ComponentB(){...}
    }
}

==================================================

component consists of

    data

        props ( from parent component )
        states ( controlled by logic )

    logic
    appearance

==================================================
props are immutable to change props you need states
==================================================
props object are recived by default 
props object are recived by default for a component
when making a list

    listElementCompenet which contains ElementCompnent
        <SkillList />
        <Skil />


props used to pass data from parent to child
===================================================
jsx is converted to create element function call 

===================================================
key (  

    {pizzas.map((pizza) => (
        <Pizza pizzaObj={pizza} key={pizza.name} />
    ))}

)

helps React keep track of which items have changed,added or removed
improve performance 

two items in the list should not have the same keys 

    lead to performance issues
    lead to correctness issue [todo:how]

    common example (using arr index as key instead should use 'id' within the ele obj)
    { id: 1, name: "Margherita", price: 10 }
    why ? assume remove ele form middle of array many states will updated
